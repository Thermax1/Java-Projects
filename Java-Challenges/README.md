# Java 100 Challenges

#### This is me documenting 100+ challenges in Java, making me relearn what I forgot and learn new topics to answer problems

## Chapter 2: Math Problems
- **Exercise 1A: BasicOperators.java**
    - I learned basic math operators
    - I learned that our method must be static to be called in main
        - I learned that an alternative is to instantiate the class of the program (BasicOperators) and create a new one. Then I can call this one in main while leaving the function non-static.
- **Exercise 1B: Statistics.java**
    - I learned about ArrayLists and adding elements to them using .add.
        - I learned that .size returns the size, which is great for printing the contents in a loop
        - I also learned the <> part must be an Object data type, so instead of int, its Integer. bool is Boolean, etc.
    - I learned about a short version of the for loop. I prefer the old one, to be honest.
- **Exercise 1C: EvenOdd.java**
    - I learned about the modulus operator. Really useful for testing true or false as well using 0 and another number
    - I also learned I can print my method since it's just holding the return value!
