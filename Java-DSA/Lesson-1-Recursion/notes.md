# Recursion

## When to Use/Avoid Recursion

- **Use**
    1. Break a problem into similar sub-problems
    2. Be okay with extra overhead (time and space) that comes with it
    3. You want a QUICK solution, not an EFFICIENT one
    4. Traversing a tree
    5. When we use memorization in recursion

- **Avoid**
    1. Time and space complexity ACTUALLY matters
    2. When memory is IMPORTANT. Recursion takes up more
    3. Recursion can be SLOW
